We continue to in this movement as Black people are both overrepresented in terms of cases of COVID-19 and in correctional settings. This week we are partnering with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/acluofcolorado/">ACLU of Colorado</a> and Colorado Attorneys Against Police Violence (CAAPV) to demand decarceration. </p><p> "A prison sentence should not be a death sentence, but... that is precisely the fate that our panelists fear for their loved ones. Among others, hear from Amber Johnson, the daughter of Ronald Johnson. Mr. Johnson is a 62-year-old grandfather who relies on an inhaler to breathe. He has turned his life around in prison after being convicted of non-violent offenses related to substance abuse, but he is still years away from release.</p><p> Panelists will also include attorneys involved in the lawsuit against the Colorado Department of Corrections and Governor Polis for their failure to protect our vulnerable, incarcerated neighbors from COVID-19. There are hundreds of medically vulnerable, sick or elderly prisoners who pose no threat to public safety, but who face a serious risk of dying of COVID-19 in Colorado’s overcrowded prisons. Join us to decarcerate and save lives."</p><p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/acluofcolorado/posts/3478847435482054">https://www.facebook.com/acluofcolorado/posts/3478847435482054</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BlackLivesMatter5280/posts/2650006855316531">See More</a><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s526x296/118269723_3475743892459075_3426725831054625827_o.jpg?_nc_cat=100&_nc_sid=b386c4&_nc_ohc=Xu6uLfddzrwAX_vTiPO&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-2.fna&tp=7&oh=19b468b857c41bc2220a0829127083ea&oe=5F6EEA08" alt="ACLU of Colorado's photo." width="504" height="263" caption="ACLU of Colorado's photo." /><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/327107741806314/"></a><p>WED, AUG 26</p><p>Covid-19 Decarceration Panel</p>Online Event<i></i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/discovery/">Causes</a> · 155 people]]></content:encoded>

Many may have their own opinions and perceptions of who he really is. To me this man is a survivor, brother, father, and role model! How could one person endure so many battles and still stand tall ready to fight whatever comes their way? At 12-13 I struggled being home with my mom due to financial disadvantages leaving me and my sister with nowhere to go or no one to turn to. Ishmael stepped in with the little he had to offer us and made the be...st of it. He made sure he picked us up whenever he felt we tried to slack off by uplifting us with his goofy ways, picking us up and dropping us off at school, and even feeding us when he could barely feed himself. Fast forward years later to him becoming a man and having a beautiful daughter named Ishanti. For a couple of years of her life he was away, but the way he stepped up as a father was not shocking to me I knew his capabilities and god knew them as well. Second time around god blesses him again with another beautiful baby girl Isharri and as he tries his hardest to do right the enemy just couldn't help trying to assassinate his character. Ishmael Salaam was then arrested and convicted life without the possibility of parole plus 100 years for a incident he did not oversee nor was he there. Gwinnett county sentenced him without the proper evidence to prosecute him for this incident! How can our black men rise when society continues to paint our men out as monsters ? How can they sentence pedophiles, molesters, rapists, and kidnappers less time with the eligibility of parole? The system is designed to break up our homes leaving single mothers alone to raise kids on their own. It makes it harder for the people who want to do right and have a second chance at life to even find jobs. Months down the line August 20th, 2020 Ishmael lost the mother of his kids to a battle most people fight on the daily known as "Depression". Mashelle committed suicide leaving their kids without the comfort of a Mothers touch or a Father's touch. They need their father more than we can imagine regardless of who is actually there with them right now no one can fill that void or their hurt like he can. SO AGAIN who is Ishmael salaam to me ? ISHMAEL is a King, a survivor, a father, a brother, a grandson, a hero to some, a shadow, a soldier, a giver, a fighter, and a courageous BLACK MAN . PLEASE help me to help him get home to his kids !! If we stand for nothing we are able to fall for anything.” <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/blackinmatesmatter">#blackinmatesmatter</a><br /> <a href="https://www.ipetitions.com/petition/bring-ish-home">https://www.ipetitions.com/petition/bring-ish-home</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BlackLivesMatter5280/posts/2649317215385495">See More</a><a href="https://www.ipetitions.com/petition/bring-ish-home">BRING ISH HOME 1357 people have signed this petition.

These loved ones are too often erased, forgotten and unknown and as a result not uplifted during national actions held here in DC. As part of our Black August events, we are bringing together the families of Black lives taken by the state during this virtual vigil.</p><p> A small group of... family members will come together in person for this very special vigil. We know that the Black community particularly in DC has been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. Therefore we are limiting the in-person attendees and are excited that the vigil will be live streamed. In this way, thousands of people will be able to send their love and support to these families by uplifting the names of their loved ones. We will be live streaming from our Facebook page and we will update people closer to the event on the other ways to watch.</p><p> RSVP to receive updates about how you can volunteer and/or watch. <a href="https://tinyurl.com/DC-ANCESTORS">https://tinyurl.com/DC-ANCESTORS</a></p><p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/nanmow2020">#NANMOW2020</a> #BlackLivesMatter <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/blacklivesmatterdc">#BlackLivesMatterDC</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/blacklivesmatter">#BlackLivesMatter</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/dcprotests">#DCProtests</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/dcprotestors">#DCProtestors</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/ancestorswatching">#AncestorsWatching</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/stopmpd">#StopMPD</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/defundmpd">#DefundMPD</a> #DefundDCPolice <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/defunddcpolice">#DefundDCPolice</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/defunddpd">#DefundDPD</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/defundapd">#DefundAPD</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/defundpolice">#DEFUNDPOLICE</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/defendblacklife">#DEFENDBLACKLIFE</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BlackLivesMatter5280/posts/2649232365393980">See More</a><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/118081923_4275927402478778_7390114532426895426_o.jpg?_nc_cat=101&_nc_sid=b386c4&_nc_ohc=UbVJNEPQYRsAX-MHnzM&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&tp=6&oh=2f5eae07c3f3139d6d1bed42aacc9c69&oe=5F6D9261" alt="Black Lives Matter DC's photo." width="500" height="282" caption="Black Lives Matter DC's photo." /><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/302353464151932/"></a><p>THU, AUG 27 AT 6:30 PM EDT</p><p>Ancestors Watching Vigil for Black Lives Lost to State Violence</p><i></i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/discovery/">Causes</a> · 1,515 people]]></content:encoded>

Their Denver home was set on fire by an unknown perpetrator at 2:30 A.M. 3 adults inside were able to escape with no life-threatening injuries, but the 5 aforementioned individuals were killed.<br /> The Denver police department is offering a $14,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of th...e killer, and the department is actively investigating the case as an arson. The Denver police have said they will not move forward with labeling this as a hate crime as they "do not want to narrow the scope of the investigation." <br /> This petition has been created to raise awareness of what has happened to the Diol family, as the media coverage has been severely lacking.  We are demanding the Denver police department increase their focus on this case and that they do not let up until their killer has been arrested, charged, and convicted. The continued trend of police departments undervaluing the lives of BIPOC individuals and failing to hold their murderers accountable must end now.

Black August, first commemorated by our incarcerated brothers and sisters, is a time to recommit ourselves to the struggle for #BlackLiberation and to honor those who&rsquo;ve contributed to our collective progress and all those who have been lost to unjust violence and systemic racism.<br />
This August 21, join us in a car protest to bring the Black August fight to our local prison walls. We will drive in a mobile protest to the Denver County Jail and the GEO Aurora ICE detention facility to let those who are chained there know that we are with them, we are fighting for them, and we will keep fighting until all chains are broken.<br />
The many injustices faced by those behind bars in the U.S. are today amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic. Prisons and jails all across the country, where medical neglect is commonplace and quarantining impossible, have become hotspots of infection. Hundreds have died in US prisons from COVID-19, and yet no response has been made to defend against unnecessary death. The mass incarceration of Black, Brown, and Indigenous populations means that they are not only disproportionately affected by the virus outside of jail, but inside as well.<br />
We raise the following demands, recognizing that if they are not met, more unnecessary death is a certainty:<br />
1. Immediate humanitarian release of all ICE detainees and all vulnerable inmates, those convicted for non-violent offenses, and those who have not been convicted at all.<br />
2. Where people remain behind bars, drastically increase medical staffing and supplies to local jails and state prisons, and guarantee sanitary conditions for all inmates.<br />
3. Free all political prisoners!<br />

<br />
Come celebrate with BLM 5280 at our Juneteenth Freedom Day Party! We will celebrate at &ldquo;The Tree&rdquo; (the site of BLM 5280's 2016 135-hour vigil) located across from the City &amp; County Building at 14th Ave &amp; Bannock. Please be advised that parking in that area is limited and/or currently blocked off. <br />
From 10am-12pm, we will have FREE #COVID-19 testing on-site for everyone, regardless of their insurance or immigration status. Results will be available within 3-5 business days. In addition, resources (water, PPE, hand sanitizer, sunscreen) will be available at our new BLM 5280 Action Hub. We will be encouraging social distancing at this event.<br />
<br />
Beginning at 12pm, there will be music (with special guests Brothers of Brass and DJ Big Styles!), food, arts, wellness activities, and celebrations of Black love and liberation throughout the day. <br />
Can't attend, but looking to donate? Venmo @blm5280]]></content:encoded>
