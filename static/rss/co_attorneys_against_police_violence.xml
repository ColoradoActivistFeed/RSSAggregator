It has put a great deal of us at-risk adult in harms way. For me, this can be a potential death sentence. At my age and with underlying health conditions, this feels like cruel and unusual punishment.”</p><p> — Anthony Martinez...</p><p> Anthony Martinez is an 84-year-old grandfather suffering from renal failure, as well as other serious medical conditions including dementia. He is currently incarcerated in the Sterling Correctional Facility, site of one of Colorado’s largest COVID-19 outbreaks with almost 600 active COVID-19 cases. He and his family are understandably terrified that he will catch the virus and die.</p><p> Anthony has spent over 30 years behind bars for a series of robberies. He has paid a substantial debt to society for these crimes. With his age and infirmity, no one can argue he is a public safety risk, but he has a substantial risk of becoming seriously ill or dying from COVID-19 if he remains incarcerated. Despite this, his special needs parole application was denied.</p><p> Anthony’s niece, Kelly, has a room in her home waiting for him to spend his final years. She says, “Only nine people on the side of the prison where my uncle is currently held are still negative for COVID-19. It’s all around him and it’s only a matter of time before he gets sick. I know my uncle is lonely and isolated. He uses a wheelchair, is hard of hearing and is locked in his cell almost all day. Prison is no place for elderly people. Please, I need my uncle home before he dies.”</p><p> In the midst of this public health crisis, incarcerated people as vulnerable as Anthony, could and should be immediately released to safely live out their remaining years with family.   <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/decarcerationday">#decarcerationday</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/freethemall">#FreeThemAll</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/covidjustice">#covidjustice</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/carenotcages">#carenotcages</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/endmassincarceration">#endmassincarceration</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/covidcolorado">#COVIDcolorado</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/doyourpart">#doyourpart</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/bringourneighborshome">#bringourneighborshome</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/redemptionisreal">#redemptionisreal</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/clemencyiscompassion">#clemencyiscompassion</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php">See More</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/106087521153591/photos/a.107461271016216/146190013810008/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/118510541_146190017143341_7052916449486077761_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=0Tw1750pbjQAX9U-Jxy&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&oh=4e3b9648a3b726e4a4e2a952d140dd50&oe=5F6C11B8" alt="Image may contain: 4 people, people standing and hat, text that says 'ACLU co NO ONE DESERVES &#x3c4;&#x3bf; DIE FROM COVID-19 MARTINEZ ANTHONY ANTHONY'S FAMILY IS READY &#x3a4;&#x3bf; WELCOME HIM HOME.'" width="500" height="500" caption="Image may contain: 4 people, people standing and hat, text that says 'ACLU co NO ONE DESERVES &#x3c4;&#x3bf; DIE FROM COVID-19 MARTINEZ ANTHONY ANTHONY'S FAMILY IS READY &#x3a4;&#x3bf; WELCOME HIM HOME.'" /></a>]]></content:encoded>

Surely he is aware that our carceral system is founded on racist principles, and the racial make-up of our prison...s is a reflection of historical and ongoing systemic racism.</p><p> Yet, rather than acknowledging the humanity of people living behind bars and the racism underlying the prison system, Gov. Polis has contributed to a public narrative that demonizes incarcerated people as unredeemable and too dangerous to be free. When advocates called for thoughtful releases of vulnerable incarcerated people, Gov. Polis’ response: He would not “let dangerous criminals out.”</p><p> Come on, governor. No one wants you to release “dangerous criminals.” We all want to be safe. That’s why advocates have been calling for the release of people who are elderly, sick, or have otherwise proven they are not a public safety threat. Decades of mass incarceration has ensured that there are many such people in Colorado’s prisons, and racism has ensured that those people will be disproportionately Black."</p><p> <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2020/08/21/colorado-prison-inmates-covid-polis-opinion/">https://www.denverpost.com/…/colorado-prison-inmates-covid…/</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php">See More</a><a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2020/08/21/colorado-prison-inmates-covid-polis-opinion/">Black people living behind bars face a racist double whammy – because of their blackness they are more likely to be imprisoned, more likely to get COVID, and more likely to die from the virus.<img src="https://external.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQDU2ss0M9u-Cnys&w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.denverpost.com%2Fwp-content%2Fthemes%2Fdenverpost%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fdenverpost.jpg&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_hash=AQDbCS4Je6GHK_kQ" alt="" width="500" height="262" caption="" /></a><p>denverpost.com</p><p>Guest commentary: If Black lives matter to him, Polis needs to reduce prison population</p>Black people living behind bars face a racist double whammy – because of their blackness they are more likely to be imprisoned, more likely to get COVID, and more likely to die from the virus.<a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2020/08/21/colorado-prison-inmates-covid-polis-opinion/">Black people living behind bars face a racist double whammy – because of their blackness they are more likely to be imprisoned, more likely to get COVID, and more likely to die from the virus.</a>]]></content:encoded>

It was challenging both because of Covid-19 and our client’s innocence (which he walked in and away with). I’m here to say that in 2021 I will work on legislation in Colorado that will strip these “oh so powerful” prosecutors of their full immunity, force them to pay defense costs upon acquittal, and institute a law that requires DA’s offices to disclose when their deputies have been found to commit misconduct, or hidden or destroyed discovery.  If any of these these three laws were enacted, our client - and many others - would never be charged with baseless and  speculative crimes.</p>]]></content:encoded>
