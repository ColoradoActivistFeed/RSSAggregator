It has put a great deal of us at-risk adult in harms way. For me, this can be a potential death sentence. At my age and with underlying health conditions, this feels like cruel and unusual punishment.”</p><p> — Anthony Martinez...</p><p> Anthony Martinez is an 84-year-old grandfather suffering from renal failure, as well as other serious medical conditions including dementia. He is currently incarcerated in the Sterling Correctional Facility, site of one of Colorado’s largest COVID-19 outbreaks with almost 600 active COVID-19 cases. He and his family are understandably terrified that he will catch the virus and die.</p><p> Anthony has spent over 30 years behind bars for a series of robberies. He has paid a substantial debt to society for these crimes. With his age and infirmity, no one can argue he is a public safety risk, but he has a substantial risk of becoming seriously ill or dying from COVID-19 if he remains incarcerated. Despite this, his special needs parole application was denied.</p><p> Anthony’s niece, Kelly, has a room in her home waiting for him to spend his final years. She says, “Only nine people on the side of the prison where my uncle is currently held are still negative for COVID-19. It’s all around him and it’s only a matter of time before he gets sick. I know my uncle is lonely and isolated. He uses a wheelchair, is hard of hearing and is locked in his cell almost all day. Prison is no place for elderly people. Please, I need my uncle home before he dies.”</p><p> In the midst of this public health crisis, incarcerated people as vulnerable as Anthony, could and should be immediately released to safely live out their remaining years with family.   <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/decarcerationday">#decarcerationday</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/freethemall">#FreeThemAll</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/covidjustice">#covidjustice</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/carenotcages">#carenotcages</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/endmassincarceration">#endmassincarceration</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/covidcolorado">#COVIDcolorado</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/doyourpart">#doyourpart</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/bringourneighborshome">#bringourneighborshome</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/redemptionisreal">#redemptionisreal</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/clemencyiscompassion">#clemencyiscompassion</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php">See More</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/106087521153591/photos/a.107461271016216/146190013810008/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/118510541_146190017143341_7052916449486077761_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=0Tw1750pbjQAX9U-Jxy&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&oh=4e3b9648a3b726e4a4e2a952d140dd50&oe=5F6C11B8" alt="Image may contain: 4 people, people standing and hat, text that says 'ACLU co NO ONE DESERVES &#x3c4;&#x3bf; DIE FROM COVID-19 MARTINEZ ANTHONY ANTHONY'S FAMILY IS READY &#x3a4;&#x3bf; WELCOME HIM HOME.'" width="500" height="500" caption="Image may contain: 4 people, people standing and hat, text that says 'ACLU co NO ONE DESERVES &#x3c4;&#x3bf; DIE FROM COVID-19 MARTINEZ ANTHONY ANTHONY'S FAMILY IS READY &#x3a4;&#x3bf; WELCOME HIM HOME.'" /></a>]]></content:encoded>

His age and respiratory ailments put him at risk of serious illness and death if he contracts COVID-19. With over hundreds of active cases in Colorado’s prisons, his family fears he will not make it out alive. His daughter, Amber, says, “In prison, he can’t protect himself and he can’t social distance. My deep fear is that my dad will die in prison. That is a...n awful, traumatic reality to consider. My chest is tight just thinking about how quickly it spreads and how vulnerable he is.” </p><p> Governor Hickenlooper shortened his sentence following testimony from family, friends and correctional officers advocating for his early release. Yet, he is still eight years away from parole. While he remains in prison, COVID-19 continues to spread. Ronald’s three siblings, four children and four grandchildren are desperate for his release.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/acluofcolorado/posts/3499408936759237">See More</a><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t15.5256-10/118464736_1057883024670238_5027461490615456778_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&_nc_sid=f2c4d5&_nc_ohc=5BKheOCFFZYAX_qUoAL&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&oh=e645cc2713837a182ba365930c9141f9&oe=5F6CF4F8" />]]></content:encoded>

Prisoners and detainees are getting sick and dying at highly elevated rates, and without immediate and sweeping action, mass deaths—disproportionately of poor, Black, Brown, and Indigenous people—are a certainty. This is why PSL Denver is backing tomorrow’s Decarceration Day of Action. Join the rally at noon tomorrow at the capitol and read Dr. Apryl Alexander’s opinion piece on the day of a...ction in the Denver Post.</p><p> “After briefly allowing increased prisoner releases, the governor has rescinded that authority and refuses to exercise any of his broad powers to safely reduce the prison population.</p><p> Surely, the governor is aware that the United States incarcerates people at a higher rate than any other country in the world, and that mass incarceration has destroyed Black communities, without improving public safety. Surely he is aware that our carceral system is founded on racist principles, and the racial make-up of our prisons is a reflection of historical and ongoing systemic racism.</p><p> Yet, rather than acknowledging the humanity of people living behind bars and the racism underlying the prison system, Gov. Polis has contributed to a public narrative that demonizes incarcerated people as unredeemable and too dangerous to be free. When advocates called for thoughtful releases of vulnerable incarcerated people, Gov. Polis’ response: He would not “let dangerous criminals out.”</p><p> Come on, governor. No one wants you to release “dangerous criminals.” We all want to be safe. That’s why advocates have been calling for the release of people who are elderly, sick, or have otherwise proven they are not a public safety threat. Decades of mass incarceration has ensured that there are many such people in Colorado’s prisons, and racism has ensured that those people will be disproportionately Black.</p><p> Here’s just one example: Ron Johnson is a 62-year-old Black grandfather who has turned his life around in prison. He suffers from asthma, high blood pressure, and uses an inhaler to breathe, so he is at high risk for COVID. He is no threat to the public. He lives in an incentive unit where he cares for other incarcerated people with medical disabilities and mentors incarcerated people earning their GED.”</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/posts/1013272209125269">See More</a><a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2020/08/21/colorado-prison-inmates-covid-polis-opinion/">Black people living behind bars face a racist double whammy – because of their blackness they are more likely to be imprisoned, more likely to get COVID, and more likely to die from the virus.<img src="https://external.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQDU2ss0M9u-Cnys&w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.denverpost.com%2Fwp-content%2Fthemes%2Fdenverpost%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fdenverpost.jpg&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_hash=AQDbCS4Je6GHK_kQ" alt="" width="500" height="262" caption="" /></a><p>denverpost.com</p><p>Guest commentary: If Black lives matter to him, Polis needs to reduce prison population</p>Black people living behind bars face a racist double whammy – because of their blackness they are more likely to be imprisoned, more likely to get COVID, and more likely to die from the virus.<a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2020/08/21/colorado-prison-inmates-covid-polis-opinion/">Black people living behind bars face a racist double whammy – because of their blackness they are more likely to be imprisoned, more likely to get COVID, and more likely to die from the virus.</a>]]></content:encoded>

WATCH THIS CLIP! This footage was taken 15 minutes before the Kenosha shooter Kyle Rittenhouse murdered two anti-racist protesters and injured a third. The cops offer the armed white supremacist vigilantes water (Rittenhouse is the one walking over to get water), and thank them for what they are doing. At the very same time, they are ordering protesters to clear the streets. 15 minutes later Kyle Rittenhouse shot 3 protesters, gave a hand si...gn to the cops, and walked right past 3 police vehicles without even being stopped. </p><p> As the system tries to clamp down on the anti-racist uprising sweeping the country, the police keep further exposing that they are not an institution with the purpose of protecting our communities, but a violent repressive force dedicated to upholding a white supremacist order. They will join forces with openly racist elements of the population who will aid them in accomplishing this task.</p><p> The anti-racist uprising of people in this country is a real threat to white supremacy, and this country’s rulers know it!

We continue to in this movement as Black people are both overrepresented in terms of cases of COVID-19 and in correctional settings. This week we are partnering with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/acluofcolorado/">ACLU of Colorado</a> and Colorado Attorneys Against Police Violence (CAAPV) to demand decarceration. </p><p> "A prison sentence should not be a death sentence, but... that is precisely the fate that our panelists fear for their loved ones. Among others, hear from Amber Johnson, the daughter of Ronald Johnson. Mr. Johnson is a 62-year-old grandfather who relies on an inhaler to breathe. He has turned his life around in prison after being convicted of non-violent offenses related to substance abuse, but he is still years away from release.</p><p> Panelists will also include attorneys involved in the lawsuit against the Colorado Department of Corrections and Governor Polis for their failure to protect our vulnerable, incarcerated neighbors from COVID-19. There are hundreds of medically vulnerable, sick or elderly prisoners who pose no threat to public safety, but who face a serious risk of dying of COVID-19 in Colorado’s overcrowded prisons. Join us to decarcerate and save lives."</p><p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/acluofcolorado/posts/3478847435482054">https://www.facebook.com/acluofcolorado/posts/3478847435482054</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BlackLivesMatter5280/posts/2650006855316531">See More</a><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s526x296/118269723_3475743892459075_3426725831054625827_o.jpg?_nc_cat=100&_nc_sid=b386c4&_nc_ohc=Xu6uLfddzrwAX_vTiPO&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-2.fna&tp=7&oh=19b468b857c41bc2220a0829127083ea&oe=5F6EEA08" alt="ACLU of Colorado's photo." width="504" height="263" caption="ACLU of Colorado's photo." /><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/327107741806314/"></a><p>WED, AUG 26</p><p>Covid-19 Decarceration Panel</p>Online Event<i></i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/discovery/">Causes</a> · 155 people]]></content:encoded>

      <title>@TuggJuan @Shontel4RTD Hi Juan. I&#39;ve been on TV in Denver for 13 years, so it&#39;s fair to blame me for the city&#39;s problems if you believe a news anchor has control over those things. Ms Lewis was elected in Nov 2018 so maybe give her a few years before blaming her for everything.</title>

Many may have their own opinions and perceptions of who he really is. To me this man is a survivor, brother, father, and role model! How could one person endure so many battles and still stand tall ready to fight whatever comes their way? At 12-13 I struggled being home with my mom due to financial disadvantages leaving me and my sister with nowhere to go or no one to turn to. Ishmael stepped in with the little he had to offer us and made the be...st of it. He made sure he picked us up whenever he felt we tried to slack off by uplifting us with his goofy ways, picking us up and dropping us off at school, and even feeding us when he could barely feed himself. Fast forward years later to him becoming a man and having a beautiful daughter named Ishanti. For a couple of years of her life he was away, but the way he stepped up as a father was not shocking to me I knew his capabilities and god knew them as well. Second time around god blesses him again with another beautiful baby girl Isharri and as he tries his hardest to do right the enemy just couldn't help trying to assassinate his character. Ishmael Salaam was then arrested and convicted life without the possibility of parole plus 100 years for a incident he did not oversee nor was he there. Gwinnett county sentenced him without the proper evidence to prosecute him for this incident! How can our black men rise when society continues to paint our men out as monsters ? How can they sentence pedophiles, molesters, rapists, and kidnappers less time with the eligibility of parole? The system is designed to break up our homes leaving single mothers alone to raise kids on their own. It makes it harder for the people who want to do right and have a second chance at life to even find jobs. Months down the line August 20th, 2020 Ishmael lost the mother of his kids to a battle most people fight on the daily known as "Depression". Mashelle committed suicide leaving their kids without the comfort of a Mothers touch or a Father's touch. They need their father more than we can imagine regardless of who is actually there with them right now no one can fill that void or their hurt like he can. SO AGAIN who is Ishmael salaam to me ? ISHMAEL is a King, a survivor, a father, a brother, a grandson, a hero to some, a shadow, a soldier, a giver, a fighter, and a courageous BLACK MAN . PLEASE help me to help him get home to his kids !! If we stand for nothing we are able to fall for anything.” <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/blackinmatesmatter">#blackinmatesmatter</a><br /> <a href="https://www.ipetitions.com/petition/bring-ish-home">https://www.ipetitions.com/petition/bring-ish-home</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BlackLivesMatter5280/posts/2649317215385495">See More</a><a href="https://www.ipetitions.com/petition/bring-ish-home">BRING ISH HOME 1357 people have signed this petition.

When advocates called for thoughtful releases of vulnerable incarcerated people, Gov. Polis’ response: He would not “let dangerous criminals out.”</p><p> Come on, governor. No one wants you to release “dangerous criminals.” We all want to be safe. That’s why advocates have been calling for the release of people who are elderly, sick, or have otherwise proven they are not a public safety threat.

These loved ones are too often erased, forgotten and unknown and as a result not uplifted during national actions held here in DC. As part of our Black August events, we are bringing together the families of Black lives taken by the state during this virtual vigil.</p><p> A small group of... family members will come together in person for this very special vigil. We know that the Black community particularly in DC has been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. Therefore we are limiting the in-person attendees and are excited that the vigil will be live streamed. In this way, thousands of people will be able to send their love and support to these families by uplifting the names of their loved ones. We will be live streaming from our Facebook page and we will update people closer to the event on the other ways to watch.</p><p> RSVP to receive updates about how you can volunteer and/or watch. <a href="https://tinyurl.com/DC-ANCESTORS">https://tinyurl.com/DC-ANCESTORS</a></p><p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/nanmow2020">#NANMOW2020</a> #BlackLivesMatter <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/blacklivesmatterdc">#BlackLivesMatterDC</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/blacklivesmatter">#BlackLivesMatter</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/dcprotests">#DCProtests</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/dcprotestors">#DCProtestors</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/ancestorswatching">#AncestorsWatching</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/stopmpd">#StopMPD</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/defundmpd">#DefundMPD</a> #DefundDCPolice <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/defunddcpolice">#DefundDCPolice</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/defunddpd">#DefundDPD</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/defundapd">#DefundAPD</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/defundpolice">#DEFUNDPOLICE</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/defendblacklife">#DEFENDBLACKLIFE</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BlackLivesMatter5280/posts/2649232365393980">See More</a><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/118081923_4275927402478778_7390114532426895426_o.jpg?_nc_cat=101&_nc_sid=b386c4&_nc_ohc=UbVJNEPQYRsAX-MHnzM&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&tp=6&oh=2f5eae07c3f3139d6d1bed42aacc9c69&oe=5F6D9261" alt="Black Lives Matter DC's photo." width="500" height="282" caption="Black Lives Matter DC's photo." /><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/302353464151932/"></a><p>THU, AUG 27 AT 6:30 PM EDT</p><p>Ancestors Watching Vigil for Black Lives Lost to State Violence</p><i></i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/discovery/">Causes</a> · 1,515 people]]></content:encoded>

If police use the term, ask: How was the officer or officers involved? Who did the shooting? If the information is not available or not provided, spell that out.</title>

I’m not talking about it’s close cousin white guilt. Penitenti...al whiteness differs from white guilt in that it is vocal. It’s more than a feeling...it falls over itself to outperform and out woke every other white “ally.” </p><p> Penitential whiteness might look and sound desirable, but I can guarantee you that it absolutely is not. It is exhausting. </p><p> Penitential whiteness is a paradox. </p><p> It demands labor by performing labor. Instead of lending quiet support behind the scenes, it is loud and in front. It needs the cookies and badges from Black people. If no cookies are given, there is an assumption that something went wrong, and so the penitential white person become insecure and needs to make sure they’re still a “good person.” </p><p> It centers itself by de-centering whiteness. Penitential whiteness makes sure that everyone knows that they are not in the center by telling everyone that they aren’t in the center. They are in the center of all of the fe-centering. </p><p> Penitential whiteness does everything at full steam. If it’s calling out other white folks penitent white folks will be the loudest and most persistent. If it is if it’s raising awareness, you can expect a full, scripted pitch. If it is showing up, it will be the first one there and the last to leave. </p><p> Penitential whiteness, on the surface, might seem like a healthy expression of allyship (or whatever y’all calling it right now). The difference between being a healthy co-conspirator and a penitential white individual is about posture. Penitential white folks can do good work, but that good work is rooted in relieving the pressure to prove their goodness rather than in the liberation of others. </p><p> Beware and be wary of penitential whiteness. It’s not a good look. At the end of the day, penitential whiteness does more harm than good because the “work” of a penitential person of whiteness is rooted in their zeal to prove themselves. </p><p> Penitential whiteness does not combat white supremacy, it reinforces it by—once again—making people of whiteness the hero of their own narratives. The narrative, in this case, is being The Best Ally That Ever Allied and sucking all of the air (and liberation) out of the room. </p><p> I don’t expect everyone to understand or agree with this word. But I hope that it will at least get folks thinking about how they approach the work of antiracism.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>

It was also an exercise in cowardly fear in the face of Trump’s open redbaiting and Muslim baiting. That was the stated reason that the party’s most popular liberal member of the House, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, received just 90 seconds to speak. That’s precisely why the Biden team joined in Trump’s condemnation of Palestinian activist Linda Sarsour after she spoke as an invited guest on a panel discussion at the convention.

Their Denver home was set on fire by an unknown perpetrator at 2:30 A.M. 3 adults inside were able to escape with no life-threatening injuries, but the 5 aforementioned individuals were killed.<br /> The Denver police department is offering a $14,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of th...e killer, and the department is actively investigating the case as an arson. The Denver police have said they will not move forward with labeling this as a hate crime as they "do not want to narrow the scope of the investigation." <br /> This petition has been created to raise awareness of what has happened to the Diol family, as the media coverage has been severely lacking.  We are demanding the Denver police department increase their focus on this case and that they do not let up until their killer has been arrested, charged, and convicted. The continued trend of police departments undervaluing the lives of BIPOC individuals and failing to hold their murderers accountable must end now.

That pressure halted Victor's deportation for now!</p><p> But the fight isn't over. We’re told that Victor will likely face deportation next week. We want him reunited with his wife and children in Pasco. We want him free. An...d we want NWDC shut down once and for all.</p><p> We've known all along that ICE lies, but today we saw once again that nothing they say can be trusted. We saw once again that ICE won't hesitate to send people to their deaths. The Mexican consulate must not be complicit in this violence.<br /> 🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨<br /> We need to flood the phone lines at consulate offices in both Seattle and San Diego to urge staff not to collaborate with ICE on Victor's deportation.</p><p> Seattle:<br /> Farid Alejandro Soberanis Garcia<br /> (206) 448-3526​ dial 5 then ext.101<br /> fsoberanis&#064;sre.gob.mx<br /> Twitter: &#064;ConsulmexSEA<br /> Facebook: &#064;ConsulMexSEA</p><p> San Diego:<br /> Victor Esponda<br /> (619) 231-8414<br /> Twitter: &#064;consulmexsdi <br /> Facebook: &#064;Consulmexsd <br /> vesponda&#064;sre.gob.mx<br /> If email bounces, tag &#064;Consulmexsd and tweet &#064;carlos_glezgtez</p><p> Sample Script:<br /> “'I’m calling/e-mailing you as a ​(fill in...

ICE terrorizes our communities and knowingly sends people to their deaths by deporting people like Mr Jiménez with serious illnesses and disabilities. The consulate must not collaborate with ICE in carrying out this violent agenda. Deportations and detention during this global pandemic put all of us at risk. The time to act on ending immigration detention is now, and the consulate has a central role to play.”<br /> ✊🏻✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿<br /> Join us at 1pm this Sunday 8/23 for a ​rally​ outside NWDC.

The neglect this government shows to Black, Brown, Indigenous, LGBTQ+ and poor folks on a daily basis is doubled behind prison walls, and tripled under pandemic conditions. </p><p> Today we brought our protest to the Denver County Jail, the Denver Women’s Correctional Facility, and the Aurora G...EO ICE Detention Center. Though this system tries to hide the horrendous abuse that happens behind bars out of sight, we will not leave behind those in cages in our struggle.  We raise the following demands, recognizing that if they are not met, more unnecessary death is a certainty:</p><p> 1. Immediate humanitarian release of all ICE detainees and all vulnerable inmates, those convicted for non-violent offenses, and those who have not been convicted at all.</p><p> 2.

The program provides a more appropriate and more humane approach to crisis involving homelessness, mental health, and substance use. The CAHOOTS program answers about one-fifth of the 911 calls in Eugene and saves the city on average $8 million per year. DASHR’s efforts, alongside other community groups and partners, resulted in the launch of the new STAR (Support Team Assisted Response) pilot program in Denver on June 1st. </p><p> Since January, DASHR has also been working with members of Aurora’s City Council to explore building a model similar to CAHOOTS. “Aurora currently has a co-responder model, but we know that a police presence can escalate a situation,“ said Councilwoman Allison Hiltz who chairs the public safety committee on council. “In looking at other models, we are better able to prioritize our community’s needs and rethink how we deliver mental health care.” She plans to present a brief update on their progress at a committee meeting on August 27, with hopes for a more complete proposal in the near future. </p><p> Natalia Marshall, whose uncle Michael Marshall was killed in the Denver jail noted that this type of response could prevent similar things from happening. “My uncle Michael had schizophrenia and when he called police to report his bible as stolen, he was met by police officers instead of mental health professionals who brought him to the jail, which led to his death.” She adds that he needed mental health services not jail. Natalia is an Aurora resident and activist for alternatives to police and criminal justice reform.</p><p> DASHR strongly believes in creating alternatives to policing, jail, and the prison industrial complex more generally. “I believe we’re in a critical moment where the ideas we’ve been fighting to achieve for years are finally getting the attention and consideration they’ve always deserved,” said Vinnie Cervantes, Organizing Director of DASHR. “It’s important that our solutions are truly alternatives to systemic harm and that they are led by the community” DASHR is committed to helping facilitate community involvement in the programs.</p><p> About DASHR<br /> Denver Alliance for Street Health Response (DASHR) is a coalition of groups and individuals who create and support community- based responses to crisis and conflict, as well as forge new narratives of public health and safety.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>

They're *still* losing massive amounts of money—$580 million in 2019—but what's key is that their gov. work is growing.
 
ICE, the military, the police—that's where they're expecting to turn a profit.

From George Floyd, to Breonna Taylor, and even here at home for Elijah McClain. </p><p> Our duties as School Board Directors do not stop when we turn our zoom meetings off or when the President uses her gavel to adjourn our meetings. </p><p> Over the summer I witnessed the inexcusable treatment of those that are unhoused, I witnessed our DPS staff and children gassed and shot at during demonstrations for Black lives, and we must never forget that those issues are intersectional with our duties as elected leaders of the largest school district in the state of Colorado. We have thousands of families in our district that face homelessness every year, our Black students and staff are ALWAYS faced with the reality that at any moment they could become another hashtag. </p><p> I have not neglected my role as one of the seven Directors, I have transformed it to represent the voice of the unheard. </p><p> Taking bold and unapologetic stances has led to our board receiving emails in support of my actions and emails that are not in support of my actions. My former campaign staff, family, and myself have been subject to harassment and death threats from those that oppose the way I stand up for community. </p><p> The calls for my resignation have been from a very small portion of folks, but allow me to give a direct response. I will not be resigning from the Denver School Board. <br /> I am grateful to my colleagues, community, and family for their ongoing support. </p><p> I have taken time to reflect on my actions and how I show up in our community, which is why over the coming months I will work with my colleagues to outline a process for the DPS Board to more clearly define how we show up when acting on behalf of the Board of Education and Denver Public Schools and individually, so there is no longer any confusion between our personal views and actions and our elected responsibilities.</p><p> As I said before I entered this office, my activism doesn’t turn off because I assumed a title, it turns up. For those that may have missed the memo, I am unapologetically Director Tay Anderson, but before anything else I am a Black man in America. </p><p> My mission has always been the same since day one and that is building a better Denver Public Schools FOR THE STUDENTS. </p><p> Thank you and I yield the remainder of my time.</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Tay2019/posts/1176273919422113">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CEDsJDJlRXn/" target="_blank"><img src="https://instagram.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/e35/117759409_1070413616707533_6475670908792870997_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net&amp;_nc_cat=109&amp;_nc_ohc=Xz17nEpBWlUAX_HkqyN&amp;oh=5cc47ec003d538dae57a61210ef030ba&amp;oe=5F71AFC7" alt="Last July, President Trump and administration officials announced to the public that Immigration and Customs Enforcement..." /></a><br><br>Last July, President Trump and administration officials announced to the public that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was planning an operation to target thousands of immigrant families that have received final deportation orders- a carefully coordinated push that was to target on up to 10 &quot;sanctuary&quot; cities across the country.<br />
<br />
Many of us in the Coalition to Close the Concentation Camps knew that it was time to take action against forces of fascism and evil- especially for our families impacted by this broken immigration system.  On July 12, 2019, radicals and impacted families split from the milquetoast Lights for Liberty vigil being conducted at the Aurora ICE Processing Center. Rebels marched  into the parking lot of GEO- where anticolonial speeches were given by indigenous youth and where the now infamous flag removal occurred. <br />
<br />
Following the flag removal and international embarrassment, the Aurora Police Department began a Twitter manhunt offering a $4k reward to identify suspects from that evening; violent crimes typically only get a $1k reward and we knew this outrageously large reward was made because two anti police flags were flown that night. Cowards at APD wouldn't fire or prosecute the murderers of Elijah McClain the following month, yet APD had the time and resources to target non-violent protestors demanding justice for immigrants.<br />
<br />
The woman featured in this powerful photo, Michelle, was eventually identified by non profit &quot;allies&quot; and served misdemeanor tampering charges; Michelle's case with Aurora dragged on for over a year. Today we have some good news: our hero was found NOT GUILTY by jury trial and walks free of all charges! Fuck APD!<br />
<br />
Michelle- you are an inspiration and a true Chingona. With you, our city sent a message to the Department of Homeland Security.  Your bravery, in addition to the life Willem Van Spronsen gave on July 13th 2019 by setting ICE's kidnapping vans in Tacoma ablaze, made ICE retreat on their planned nationwide mass arrests of immigrants.<br />

Black August, first commemorated by our incarcerated brothers and sisters, is a time to recommit ourselves to the struggle for #BlackLiberation and to honor those who&rsquo;ve contributed to our collective progress and all those who have been lost to unjust violence and systemic racism.<br />
This August 21, join us in a car protest to bring the Black August fight to our local prison walls. We will drive in a mobile protest to the Denver County Jail and the GEO Aurora ICE detention facility to let those who are chained there know that we are with them, we are fighting for them, and we will keep fighting until all chains are broken.<br />
The many injustices faced by those behind bars in the U.S. are today amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic. Prisons and jails all across the country, where medical neglect is commonplace and quarantining impossible, have become hotspots of infection. Hundreds have died in US prisons from COVID-19, and yet no response has been made to defend against unnecessary death. The mass incarceration of Black, Brown, and Indigenous populations means that they are not only disproportionately affected by the virus outside of jail, but inside as well.<br />
We raise the following demands, recognizing that if they are not met, more unnecessary death is a certainty:<br />
1. Immediate humanitarian release of all ICE detainees and all vulnerable inmates, those convicted for non-violent offenses, and those who have not been convicted at all.<br />
2. Where people remain behind bars, drastically increase medical staffing and supplies to local jails and state prisons, and guarantee sanitary conditions for all inmates.<br />
3. Free all political prisoners!<br />

You might recognize Kesha and Leah from their incredible work at the &#064;abolishicedenver encampment that took place in front of the GEO detention center in Aurora this summer. Kesha and Leah spent 79 days camped there advocating for Pablo’s freedom and the freedom of all people detained inside. Kesha’s work—leading nightly vigils, talking with media, selling t-shirts, helped raise thousands of dollars not just... for her husband’s legal costs but also those of other impacted families. Her advocacy also led to the universal COVID testing provided at the facility (at that time, one of only two in the country to test everyone inside). On July 11 her husband was transferred to Teller county in retaliation for their activism, but Kesha stayed at GEO advocating for the liberation of all detainees. Support her this weekend by buying tacos. <a href="https://tinyurl.com/solidaritymealsaugust22">tinyurl.com/solidaritymealsaugust22</a> &#064; Denver, Colorado</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Sanctuary4AllCO/posts/2704426173179632">See More</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Sanctuary4AllCO/photos/pcb.2704426173179632/2704426053179644/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s261x260/117803864_2704426059846310_3082127598261029416_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&_nc_sid=9e2e56&_nc_ohc=w9lYG40LQncAX-fqk7V&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&tp=7&oh=df7e510d2aafe751c81b316d98dd3d24&oe=5F6C77ED" alt="Image may contain: 3 people, people standing, closeup and indoor" width="250" height="250" caption="Image may contain: 3 people, people standing, closeup and indoor" /></a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Sanctuary4AllCO/photos/pcb.2704426173179632/2704426126512970/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s261x260/117845101_2704426133179636_9170883169215797025_o.jpg?_nc_cat=110&_nc_sid=9e2e56&_nc_ohc=sJ9Eq3F6S20AX8coyZ3&_nc_oc=AQn4IJCtwHE8Vvy0CpZ_4YdGH2Qe_i0dS3aXXL78JSzfr2Ilhqe_yydL2MzkFnwh_-k&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-1.fna&tp=7&oh=5148a410b03d376aecb9fa8d98c5c14e&oe=5F6DE8EB" alt="Image may contain: text that says 'tacos TACOS VECETARIANOS $2 POTATO& MUSHROOM TACOS SERVED WITH CILANTRO, RED ONION, SALSA VERDE & SALSA ROJA TACOS DE BARBACOA $2 BARBACOA TACOS SERVED WITH CILANTRO, RED ONION, SALSA VERDE & SALSA ROJA ONE POUND OF TACOS DE BARBACOA $12 A POUND OF READY-TO-ASSEMBLE BARBACOA WITH TORTILLAS, CILANTRO, ONION, SALSA ROJA & SALSA VERDE PROVIDED TINYURL.COM/SOLIDARITYMEALSAUGUST2 &#064;KESHA-DAVALOS'" width="250" height="250" caption="Image may contain: text that says 'tacos TACOS VECETARIANOS $2 POTATO& MUSHROOM TACOS SERVED WITH CILANTRO, RED ONION, SALSA VERDE & SALSA ROJA TACOS DE BARBACOA $2 BARBACOA TACOS SERVED WITH CILANTRO, RED ONION, SALSA VERDE & SALSA ROJA ONE POUND OF TACOS DE BARBACOA $12 A POUND OF READY-TO-ASSEMBLE BARBACOA WITH TORTILLAS, CILANTRO, ONION, SALSA ROJA & SALSA VERDE PROVIDED TINYURL.COM/SOLIDARITYMEALSAUGUST2 &#064;KESHA-DAVALOS'" /></a>]]></content:encoded>

She started organizing as a member of the &#064;seiu105 and went on to help found &#064;co_immigrant, the Metro Denver Sanctuary Coalition, MUJERR, Sanctuary4All, and &#064;abolishicedenver.

It was challenging both because of Covid-19 and our client’s innocence (which he walked in and away with). I’m here to say that in 2021 I will work on legislation in Colorado that will strip these “oh so powerful” prosecutors of their full immunity, force them to pay defense costs upon acquittal, and institute a law that requires DA’s offices to disclose when their deputies have been found to commit misconduct, or hidden or destroyed discovery.  If any of these these three laws were enacted, our client - and many others - would never be charged with baseless and  speculative crimes.</p>]]></content:encoded>

When will the City ever learn that homeless whack-a-mole does not work!?? It does not create housing, it does not connect people to the little housing that there is, it does not solve health and safety concerns, it does not make homelessness disappear. We need Solutions Not Sweeps!!*&!</p><p> In the early days of COVID the city publicly agreed to “not displace people or their property” from encampments. Then they back tracked on that…They lied to the community. But there was a standing agreement from the City under the Department of Transportation and Infrastructure (DOTI) that, “Due to the COVID-19 crisis, once the area is cleaned, people experiencing homelessness may return to the cleaned area, if they choose to do so.”  We are demanding they at least follow this agreement! </p><p> Even better the City should actually start following the CDC guidance - not sweeping encampments and rather providing necessary sanitation resources. </p><p> Displacing everyone even for a day instead of providing sanitation resources, support resources, and ultimately housing is not the answer...But scattering everyone to who knows where is fundamentally not a solution. </p><p> We cannot keep pretending homelessness will disappear with sweeps. If we even want homelessness to disappear we have to start fighting for attainable housing for ALL and not fighting the visibility of homelessness. </p><p> Be there Monday morning at 12th and Acoma. Demand Solutions Not Sweeps!!!</p><p> Note: There is also a planned sweep at 13th and Washington on Tuesday August 18th, as well as a likely swept attempt at 29th and Welton that day.</p><p> Contact:<br /> info&#064;denverhomelessoutloud.org<br /> 720-940-5291</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CD4JIkZl_ge/" target="_blank"><img src="https://instagram.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/e35/117796655_1457230414478585_3109650300336961132_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net&amp;_nc_cat=105&amp;_nc_ohc=hbGO2xftAbgAX8q6J5K&amp;oh=52f19a0e13e744c6665ff58baf660d5b&amp;oe=5F70F4F7" alt=""All we are asking is to be transferred back to the Aurora facility. We are not asking for a release. They have the..." /></a><br><br>&quot;All we are asking is to be transferred back to the Aurora facility. We are not asking for a release. They have the authority to transfer us immediately if we want,&quot; says Jimmy Sodhi, a 45-year-old ICE detainee.<br />
<br />
Sodhi is part of a group of eight ICE detainees who have been housed in the same dormitory at the Teller County Jail since being transferred there from the Aurora Contract Detention Facility one month ago. Sodhi and the other ICE detainees began the hunger strike on the morning of August 10 to protest what they allege are significantly worse conditions at Aurora GEO.<br />
<br />
&quot;As a Sikh, I'm not allowed to wear my Sikh bracelet, I'm not allowed to cover my head. If I have to pray, it's required for me to cover my head. I'm told to cover my head with a pillowcase or a towel,&quot; says Sodhi, who has been in ICE custody since March 2017 and is currently in the appeals process of his deportation case stemming from a fraud conviction for insider trading. &quot;That is very demeaning, very disrespectful.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sodhi notes that he was allowed to wear his turban at the Aurora detention facility, but has been told by staff at the Teller County Jail that he cannot retrieve his turban from his personal belongings. Same with prayer books, Sodhi adds, which he hasn't been able to obtain, being told by staff that &quot;there's no chaplain here and we don't have those here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Additionally, Sodhi contends that he and other ICE detainees at the Teller County Jail have been subjected to racial harassment perpetrated by non-ICE detainees staying in the same dormitory.<br />
<br />
[...]<br />
<br />
Adding to his angst, Sodhi contends that he and the other detainees don't even know why they're being housed in the Teller County Jail, which has an agreement with ICE to house immigrant detainees.<br />

Even if we oppose the Democrats on a good many issues, this year the Republicans are so evil and the implications so grave that we must “tactically” and “temporarily” unite with the Democratic Party. But the notion of “temporary” support is disproven by the fact these “leftists” have been saying the exact same thing every four years for decades!</p><p> What they are reinforcing ...is not some tactical exception, but a political strategy based on repeated and periodic unity with the “less evil” section of the ruling class.</p><p> What has this strategy, the same at each election, delivered? Even when the Democrats have been in complete control of government, the year-to-year drift in U.S. politics has been towards the right, attacks on labor, severe austerity, a racist and draconian criminal justice system and renewed assaults on women’s rights. This has been the case under Obama too.<br /> ...<br /> Two points must be emphasized: 1) To shift the political climate in favor of poor and working people requires a mass movement embodying their demands. 2) The Democratic Party will never represent such a movement, and only seek to misrepresent it for its own purposes.</p><p> Millions of people agree with the first point, but are not yet sure of the second. The elections must be used as a venue to speak directly to these issues, clarify the nature of capitalism and expose the country’s political leadership.”</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/posts/1002088160243674">See More</a><a href="https://www.liberationnews.org/lesser-evil-politics-html/#.XzRl1KNMGdO">While defenders of the "lesser evil" Democratic Party believe they are holding the line against even further right-wing encroachment, they in fact encourage it. #elections #socialism<img src="https://external.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQD66PZL5dA3VSlt&w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.liberationnews.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2012%2F10%2Fdem-donkey.jpg&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_hash=AQAcPg6gBQ61GvIE" alt="" width="500" height="262" caption="" /></a><p>liberationnews.org</p><p>‘Lesser-evil’ politics demoralize and demobilize progressives</p>While defenders of the "lesser evil" Democratic Party believe they are holding the line against even further right-wing encroachment, they in fact encourage it. #elections #socialism<a href="https://www.liberationnews.org/lesser-evil-politics-html/#.XzRl1KNMGdO">While defenders of the "lesser evil" Democratic Party believe they are holding the line against even further right-wing encroachment, they in fact encourage it. #elections #socialism</a>]]></content:encoded>

We are still in this fight for the long haul - aka until we #FreeThemAll. <br />
<br />
Camp Free Them All has been a success in that we: saved lives, forced Aurora GEO to be one of two detention centers in the so-called United States to be offering COVID testing, forced a congressional hearing on COVID in ICE detection centers, stopped an illegal deporation, supported families with your love &amp; money and built so much power together this summer! ✊💖<br />
<br />
Despite these successes, we found out last week that nearly a third of the detainees are now being quarantined due to COVID and we fully intend to keep up the pressure on GEO, ICE &amp; DHS. <br />
<br />
Stay tuned for our next steps at Aurora GEO and if you want to help keep impacted families out of ICE custody, please donate directly to families!<br />

And please join us for a special Sunday vigil and Pablo's birthday celebration!<br />

The two men were not arrested, but instead were given assistance by police and let go. This attack was nothing less than white supremacist terrorism intended to halt the advance of the anti-racist struggle. Just as white supremacy resisted the advance towards equality duri...ng Reconstruction and the Civil Rights movement, so it does today. It is critical that in these moments, we stand together as a community and demonstrate our commitment to carrying forward the struggle against racism.</p><p> Join us August 30 for a march bringing together Denver and Aurora to demonstrate our unity and determination in the fight against racism and police violence. Attendees are invited to march on foot or in their cars. Please stay tuned for opportunities to volunteer and otherwise support this event. If you are a community leader or part of an organization that would like to endorse this demonstration, please message us!</p><p> Event page: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/351526215840428/">https://facebook.com/events/351526215840428/</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/posts/995811820871308">See More</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/photos/a.378847259234437/995811224204701/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/117300915_995811227538034_1561042489185099185_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=StjJtyFUcygAX80duBZ&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-2.fna&tp=6&oh=4ddf8862b7db7c81b7b546ff744c3aba&oe=5F6D5B36" alt="Image may contain: 3 people, text that says 'DENVER ER-AURORA MARCH AGAINST RACISM & POLICE VIOLENCE SUN.

(Hint: we think it should include abolishing the police.) <br /> We share many others' skepticism about task forces like these, but we know and respect many of the conveners of this forum..., we believe in community engagement even when skepticism is warranted, and as the saying goes, "if you're not at the table, you're probably on the menu."

NOW WE MUST FIGHT FOR THEM, TOO</p><p> "We know this fight is far from over. In many ways, it’s just beginning. DACA was made possible thanks to the organizing efforts of young immigrants, many of them queer, who pushed President Obama to announce it in the summer of 2012...For many of us, including myself, DACA was never the end goal. We knew in 2012 that DACA was supposed to be a stepping stone towards liberation and protection for all our families, especially those who are often deemed not deserving of rights. Our end goal is the safety and liberation of all people, but especially of trans and queer undocumented people."</p><p> - Jorge Gutierrez, Familia; Trans Queer Liberation</p><a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/3167062/supreme-court-daca-decision-oped/">The Supreme Court upheld the Obama-era policy, but there is still work to be done to protect the most vulnerable among us<img src="https://external.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQCDA14HbAH7LmV3&w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmtv.mtvnimages.com%2Furi%2Fmgid%3Aao%3Aimage%3Amtv.com%3A693512%3Fquality%3D0.8%26format%3Djpg%26width%3D1440%26height%3D810%26.jpg&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_hash=AQBClUwqUkkuGzlS" alt="" width="500" height="262" caption="" /></a><p>mtv.com</p><p>DACA Was Made Possible By Young LGBTQ+ Immigrants.

<br />
Come celebrate with BLM 5280 at our Juneteenth Freedom Day Party! We will celebrate at &ldquo;The Tree&rdquo; (the site of BLM 5280's 2016 135-hour vigil) located across from the City &amp; County Building at 14th Ave &amp; Bannock. Please be advised that parking in that area is limited and/or currently blocked off. <br />
From 10am-12pm, we will have FREE #COVID-19 testing on-site for everyone, regardless of their insurance or immigration status. Results will be available within 3-5 business days. In addition, resources (water, PPE, hand sanitizer, sunscreen) will be available at our new BLM 5280 Action Hub. We will be encouraging social distancing at this event.<br />
<br />
Beginning at 12pm, there will be music (with special guests Brothers of Brass and DJ Big Styles!), food, arts, wellness activities, and celebrations of Black love and liberation throughout the day. <br />

Por que la comunidad Negra está marchando y protestando en estos momentos? Porque la policía sigue matando a la gente Negra. Porque la patrulla fronteriza está matando a nuestra gente en la frontera entonces mi llamado ahorita en nuestra comunidad es pensar más allá de nosotros, hacer todas las conecciones, tomar las calles, organizarnos para que toda esta violencia puede terminar. Y ustedes como Univisión tienen responsabilidad de contar toda la historia de todo lo que esta pasando así como hablamos de las deportaciones ustedes también tienen que hablar por que la gente sigue muriendo en manos de la policía, particularmente la gente Negra. Ese es mi llamado. En este momento hacer negocio con esta administración es una traición a la comunidad Negra y a las familias que siguen muriendo."</p><p> ******<br /> Sign the petition to demand Univisión and Telemundo stop their antiBlack coverage:  <a href="https://bit.ly/lasvidasnegrasimportan">bit.ly/lasvidasnegrasimportan</a>  </p><p> "I understand that there is going to be a lot of pain right now for our community but we also have a responsibility to make connections between everything that is happening. Why is the Black community marching and protesting right now? Because the police are still killing Black people. Because border patrol is killing our people. So my call to action right now in our community is to think beyond us, make these connections, take to the streets, and organize so that all this violence can end. And you as Univision have a responsibility to tell the whole story of everything that is happening, just like how we talk about deportations, you also have to talk about why people keep dying at the hands of the police, particularly Black people. That is my call to action. Right now doing business with this administration is a betrayal of the Black community and the families that continue to die.

We see this new community-driven service as a form of preventative medicine for police violence. If it had been in place long ...ago, could have prevented the deaths of Elijah McClain, Michael Marshall, Paul Castaway, Paul Childs, and countless other victims of police violence in Denver. <br /> Abolition is not a metaphor - it's a tangible possibility, and this is an important example of how our communities can start to build the alternatives to modern policing that we need to keep our communities safe. We can have a world without police. We can have a world without prisons.

If white folks want to take the protest in a direction that does not follow the vision of the organizers, avoid following suit." /></a>]]></content:encoded>

Lorena Borjas paved the way for many of us fighting for trans and queer liberation and our movement will not be the same without her.

Lorena Borjas nos abrió el camino a muchos de nosotrxs luchando para la liberación trans y queer y nuestro movimiento no será lo mismo sin ella.

Point in Time is a count that is done across the US of all individuals who are experiencing homelessness. It is important for Aurora to have an accurate count for funding of the various nonprofits who serve this population of individuals. The city has asked Aurora Warms the Night to do the count along the colfax corridor. We are aiming to have 12 tea...ms of 3 or 4 people including a friend from the street to do the survey. We will meet at our office on Colfax at 5pm & will be out until 10:30 or 11pm. We are in need of fluent spanish speakers as well.</p><p> Anyone who wishes to participate is required to attend an information meeting on Jan 21st or 23rd from 5:30-7pm at the Aurora Municipal Center. The address is 15151 E Alameda Pkwy.<br /> Please let me know if you have any questions. If you are available to join us & attend a training please send an email to Leah at volunteers&#064;awtnco.org (also let me know if you speak spanish!)</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AuroraWarmstheNight/posts/2635108409872486">See More</a>]]></content:encoded>
