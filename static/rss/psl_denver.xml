Prisoners and detainees are getting sick and dying at highly elevated rates, and without immediate and sweeping action, mass deaths—disproportionately of poor, Black, Brown, and Indigenous people—are a certainty. This is why PSL Denver is backing tomorrow’s Decarceration Day of Action. Join the rally at noon tomorrow at the capitol and read Dr. Apryl Alexander’s opinion piece on the day of a...ction in the Denver Post.</p><p> “After briefly allowing increased prisoner releases, the governor has rescinded that authority and refuses to exercise any of his broad powers to safely reduce the prison population.</p><p> Surely, the governor is aware that the United States incarcerates people at a higher rate than any other country in the world, and that mass incarceration has destroyed Black communities, without improving public safety. Surely he is aware that our carceral system is founded on racist principles, and the racial make-up of our prisons is a reflection of historical and ongoing systemic racism.</p><p> Yet, rather than acknowledging the humanity of people living behind bars and the racism underlying the prison system, Gov. Polis has contributed to a public narrative that demonizes incarcerated people as unredeemable and too dangerous to be free. When advocates called for thoughtful releases of vulnerable incarcerated people, Gov. Polis’ response: He would not “let dangerous criminals out.”</p><p> Come on, governor. No one wants you to release “dangerous criminals.” We all want to be safe. That’s why advocates have been calling for the release of people who are elderly, sick, or have otherwise proven they are not a public safety threat. Decades of mass incarceration has ensured that there are many such people in Colorado’s prisons, and racism has ensured that those people will be disproportionately Black.</p><p> Here’s just one example: Ron Johnson is a 62-year-old Black grandfather who has turned his life around in prison. He suffers from asthma, high blood pressure, and uses an inhaler to breathe, so he is at high risk for COVID. He is no threat to the public. He lives in an incentive unit where he cares for other incarcerated people with medical disabilities and mentors incarcerated people earning their GED.”</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/posts/1013272209125269">See More</a><a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2020/08/21/colorado-prison-inmates-covid-polis-opinion/">Black people living behind bars face a racist double whammy – because of their blackness they are more likely to be imprisoned, more likely to get COVID, and more likely to die from the virus.<img src="https://external.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQDU2ss0M9u-Cnys&w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.denverpost.com%2Fwp-content%2Fthemes%2Fdenverpost%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fdenverpost.jpg&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_hash=AQDbCS4Je6GHK_kQ" alt="" width="500" height="262" caption="" /></a><p>denverpost.com</p><p>Guest commentary: If Black lives matter to him, Polis needs to reduce prison population</p>Black people living behind bars face a racist double whammy – because of their blackness they are more likely to be imprisoned, more likely to get COVID, and more likely to die from the virus.<a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2020/08/21/colorado-prison-inmates-covid-polis-opinion/">Black people living behind bars face a racist double whammy – because of their blackness they are more likely to be imprisoned, more likely to get COVID, and more likely to die from the virus.</a>]]></content:encoded>

WATCH THIS CLIP! This footage was taken 15 minutes before the Kenosha shooter Kyle Rittenhouse murdered two anti-racist protesters and injured a third. The cops offer the armed white supremacist vigilantes water (Rittenhouse is the one walking over to get water), and thank them for what they are doing. At the very same time, they are ordering protesters to clear the streets. 15 minutes later Kyle Rittenhouse shot 3 protesters, gave a hand si...gn to the cops, and walked right past 3 police vehicles without even being stopped. </p><p> As the system tries to clamp down on the anti-racist uprising sweeping the country, the police keep further exposing that they are not an institution with the purpose of protecting our communities, but a violent repressive force dedicated to upholding a white supremacist order. They will join forces with openly racist elements of the population who will aid them in accomplishing this task.</p><p> The anti-racist uprising of people in this country is a real threat to white supremacy, and this country’s rulers know it! Keep up the fight!</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/posts/1013209419131548">See More</a><a href="https://twitter.com/AFriendlyDad/status/1298510289197916160">“LOOK AT THIS CLIP! LOOK!

It was also an exercise in cowardly fear in the face of Trump’s open redbaiting and Muslim baiting. That was the stated reason that the party’s most popular liberal member of the House, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, received just 90 seconds to speak. That’s precisely why the Biden team joined in Trump’s condemnation of Palestinian activist Linda Sarsour after she spoke as an invited guest on a panel discussion at the convention.

The neglect this government shows to Black, Brown, Indigenous, LGBTQ+ and poor folks on a daily basis is doubled behind prison walls, and tripled under pandemic conditions. </p><p> Today we brought our protest to the Denver County Jail, the Denver Women’s Correctional Facility, and the Aurora G...EO ICE Detention Center. Though this system tries to hide the horrendous abuse that happens behind bars out of sight, we will not leave behind those in cages in our struggle.  We raise the following demands, recognizing that if they are not met, more unnecessary death is a certainty:</p><p> 1. Immediate humanitarian release of all ICE detainees and all vulnerable inmates, those convicted for non-violent offenses, and those who have not been convicted at all.</p><p> 2. Where people remain behind bars, drastically increase medical staffing and supplies to local jails and state prisons, and guarantee sanitary conditions for all inmates.</p><p> 3.

Even when the Democrats have been in complete control of government, the year-to-year drift in U.S. politics has been towards the right, attacks on labor, severe austerity, a racist and draconian criminal justice system and renewed assaults on women’s rights. This has been the case under Obama too.<br /> ...<br /> Two points must be emphasized: 1) To shift the political climate in favor of poor and working people requires a mass movement embodying their demands. 2) The Democratic Party will never represent such a movement, and only seek to misrepresent it for its own purposes.</p><p> Millions of people agree with the first point, but are not yet sure of the second. The elections must be used as a venue to speak directly to these issues, clarify the nature of capitalism and expose the country’s political leadership.”</p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/posts/1002088160243674">See More</a><a href="https://www.liberationnews.org/lesser-evil-politics-html/#.XzRl1KNMGdO">While defenders of the "lesser evil" Democratic Party believe they are holding the line against even further right-wing encroachment, they in fact encourage it. #elections #socialism<img src="https://external.fapa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQD66PZL5dA3VSlt&w=540&h=282&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.liberationnews.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2012%2F10%2Fdem-donkey.jpg&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher&_nc_hash=AQAcPg6gBQ61GvIE" alt="" width="500" height="262" caption="" /></a><p>liberationnews.org</p><p>‘Lesser-evil’ politics demoralize and demobilize progressives</p>While defenders of the "lesser evil" Democratic Party believe they are holding the line against even further right-wing encroachment, they in fact encourage it. #elections #socialism<a href="https://www.liberationnews.org/lesser-evil-politics-html/#.XzRl1KNMGdO">While defenders of the "lesser evil" Democratic Party believe they are holding the line against even further right-wing encroachment, they in fact encourage it. #elections #socialism</a>]]></content:encoded>

The two men were not arrested, but instead were given assistance by police and let go. This attack was nothing less than white supremacist terrorism intended to halt the advance of the anti-racist struggle. Just as white supremacy resisted the advance towards equality duri...ng Reconstruction and the Civil Rights movement, so it does today. It is critical that in these moments, we stand together as a community and demonstrate our commitment to carrying forward the struggle against racism.</p><p> Join us August 30 for a march bringing together Denver and Aurora to demonstrate our unity and determination in the fight against racism and police violence. Attendees are invited to march on foot or in their cars. Please stay tuned for opportunities to volunteer and otherwise support this event. If you are a community leader or part of an organization that would like to endorse this demonstration, please message us!</p><p> Event page: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/351526215840428/">https://facebook.com/events/351526215840428/</a></p> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/posts/995811820871308">See More</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/denverPSL/photos/a.378847259234437/995811224204701/"><img src="https://scontent.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/117300915_995811227538034_1561042489185099185_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=StjJtyFUcygAX80duBZ&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-2.fna&tp=6&oh=4ddf8862b7db7c81b7b546ff744c3aba&oe=5F6D5B36" alt="Image may contain: 3 people, text that says 'DENVER ER-AURORA MARCH AGAINST RACISM & POLICE VIOLENCE SUN.
